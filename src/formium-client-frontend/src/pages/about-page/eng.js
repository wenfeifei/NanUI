      <h2>Sponsor</h2>
      <p>
        The NanUI project is an open source project based on the LGPL-3.0
        agreement and it is completely free. Without proper financial support,
        project maintenance and the development of new features cannot be
        sustained. So if you like this project and approve of my work, you buy
        me a cup of coffee, or you can become a long-term project sponsor to
        help NanUI better.
